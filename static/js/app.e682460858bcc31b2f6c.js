This is the final product of a UI/UX class. My friend, Jisu, and I made this website with the theme of "collaboration" in mind. Our goal was to help provide a service where students can inquire about a particular major or minor, and other students can provide information.\n\nIn the beginning, one of the hardest tasks for this project was to find a reliable way to utilize JSON objects. This was a requirement for our website. In the end, we deicded to make our project utilize a noSQL server with JSON objects. All of our data is saved in JSON objects, which is accessed by AJAX.\n\nTo write to our JSON files, we used PHP scripts, which was called with our AJAX calls.\n\nBesides that, our other requirement was to use elements of Bootstrap. Besides the container class and the col class, my friend and I styled everything else ourselves. We also used a lot of jQuery to help with events, and changing pages within our website.',url:"https://devsky.org/compair"},{title:"BF Summon",language:[!0,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!1,!0],date:"June 2015 - October 2015",content:'BF Summon Simulator, or Brave Frontier Summon Simulator, is my first attempted at making an Android app as well as showing my love for the first mobile gacha game I played. The idea behind this app is to create a way for my friends to help their "gambling mindset". The overall function of the app is complete, but extra relavant features such as adding all of the units from the game into the pool is not. I stored images of a few units into my Dropbox, and the images of the units are retrieved using sockets to get the images from my Dropbox.\n\nBesides just simulating summons, I wanted to be able to add my own units into the game. This was done by having the user fill out a form, which contains the relavant information needed for a unit. Afterwards, that unit is added into the pool of default units, and becomes available to summon. This feature was the hardest part for me because I struggled a lot with using implicit intents to open an image selector for the custom unit.\n\nI stopped working on this project because the core feature is complete. You can pull for a unit in the pool, and you can add units into the pool. Expanding on the base pool is very tedious because the game has over 300 units, meaning that I would have to get 300 images. Instead, I am currently working on another app with the same concept: simulating unit pulls.
